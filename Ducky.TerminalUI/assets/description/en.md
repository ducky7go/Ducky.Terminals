# Terminal UI - Universal Console Interface for Mods
Repository: https://github.com/ducky7go/Ducky.Terminals
## What is Terminal UI?
Terminal UI is a universal console interface framework for Escape from Duckkov. It provides a centralized command-line interface where all compatible mods can register their commands, creating a unified control center for mod management and operations.
## How to Use
### Opening the Terminal
1. Launch the game and enter any scene
2. Move your mouse to the bottom-left corner of the screen
3. A trigger area will appear - click it to open the terminal
4. The terminal slides in from the left side, occupying 50% of the screen
### Selecting a Mod Provider
1. Click the "Select Provider" button at the bottom-left of the terminal
2. A list of all connected mods will appear
3. Click any mod to select it as the active provider
4. Alternatively, type # followed by the mod's short ID (e.g., #816, #dem) to filter providers quickly
### Executing Commands
1. After selecting a provider, type commands in the input field at the bottom
2. Press Enter to execute the command
3. Results will be displayed in the scrollable message area above
4. Use help or /? to see available commands for the selected provider
